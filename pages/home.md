My name is Abraham Velázquez Tello. As hybrid developer-designer, my goal is to execute high‑quality user experiences for the open web. I’ve worked for clients ranging from not‑for‑profit organizations serving minority communities to Fortune 500 companies. Currently living in Oakland and working as a Sr. Frontend Engineer at [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com) and previously was a lead developer on [Apple.com](http://apple.com/). I'm the proprietor of [lunaroja.org](http://lunaroja.org) and the founder of [Gozamos.com](http://gozamos.com).
