My name is Abraham Velázquez Tello. As hybrid developer-designer, my goal is to execute high‑quality user experiences for the open web. I’ve worked for clients ranging from Fortune 500 companies to not‑for‑profit organizations serving minority communities. I'm the proprietor of [lunaroja.org](http://lunaroja.org) and the founder of [Gozamos.com](http://gozamos.com).
