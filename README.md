This is my personal website. Itâ€™s generated with Jekyll/GH-Pages and Markdown. The design is a fork fork of the [Casper Theme](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper/) from Ghost.

## Build System
To develop locally it uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [LibSass](http://libsass.org/), [AutoPrefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) and [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/)

## Forking
